# TwitchTotals
Twitch Streamer (https://www.twitch.tv) popularity on /r/LivestreamFail

Used reddit's Pushshift API to get all titles in the date range from /r/LiveStreamFail

The titles of submissions to the subreddit were parsed to find some top streamers names.
These were totalled up and used to graph compared to other top streamers for the respective month.

The program prints out the streamer that has the most mentions in titles for each month. The order
is descending dates. The program also saves each plot for the user to view. Plots are all saved in 
`2019to2017Plots`
